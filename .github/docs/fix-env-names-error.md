# Fix: "ENV_NAMES is required but not provided in API input"

## âœ… Problem Solved!

This error has been fixed in the latest version. The issue was that GitHub Actions validation was running before environment variables were loaded.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

1. **Moved validation** from shell script to Python script
2. **Split workflow steps** so variables are properly loaded
3. **Added better error messages** with debugging information
4. **Created test tools** for local validation

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Fix

### 1. Try Your Original Request

Your request should now work:

```json
{
  "ref": "main",
  "inputs": {
    "GITHUB_PIPELINE_API_INPUT": "{\"ENV_NAMES\": \"test-cluster/e02\", \"ENV_BUILDER\": \"true\", \"DEPLOYMENT_TICKET_ID\": \"TEST-TICKET-1\", \"ENV_TEMPLATE_VERSION\": \"qubership_envgene_templates:0.0.2\"}"
  }
}
```

### 2. Use Debug Request

Try the new "Debug - Test ENV_NAMES Only" request in Postman:

```json
{
  "ref": "main",
  "inputs": {
    "GITHUB_PIPELINE_API_INPUT": "{\"ENV_NAMES\": \"test-cluster/e01\"}"
  }
}
```

### 3. Local Testing

Test locally before API calls:

```bash
cd .github/scripts
python test_api_input.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ Changes Made

### `.github/scripts/process_api_input.py`
- âœ… Added ENV_NAMES validation inside Python script
- âœ… Improved error messages with variable listing
- âœ… Added input length debugging

### `.github/workflows/pipeline-api.yml`
- âœ… Removed duplicate validation from shell
- âœ… Split into separate steps for proper variable loading
- âœ… Added better comments

### Postman Collection
- âœ… Added "Debug - Test ENV_NAMES Only" request
- âœ… Updated documentation links

### Documentation
- âœ… Added troubleshooting section
- âœ… Added local testing guide
- âœ… Added common issues and solutions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test with minimal request** first
2. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed parsing info
3. **Use local test script** if issues persist
4. **Try different formats** (JSON/YAML/Key=Value)

Your original request format was correct - the issue was with the validation timing!
